    "#Q1. Write all the conventions being followed while declaring a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "1.Use descriptive names: Choose meaningful names for your variables that indicate their purpose or content. This makes the code more understandable to\n",
    "others and your future self.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Start with a letter: Variable names should always start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) rather than a number or special character.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Use camelCase or snake_case: Depending on the language and coding style, variables can be written in camelCase (e.g., myVariableName) or \n",
    "snake_case (e.g., my_variable_name). Stick to the convention commonly used in the project or organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Avoid reserved words: Do not use keywords or reserved words of the programming language as variable names (e.g., if, else, while, int, float, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Use nouns for objects: Generally, variables represent objects or data. Use nouns to name them, as it helps to clarify their purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Use lowercase letters: In most languages, variable names are case-sensitive. Using all lowercase letters is a common convention, while uppercase is \n",
    "often reserved for constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Be consistent: Once you choose a naming convention, be consistent throughout your codebase to maintain uniformity.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Avoid abbreviations (if possible): Try to avoid excessive abbreviations in variable names. While some common abbreviations are acceptable, clarity \n",
    "should be a priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.Use underscores for multi-word names: In languages that use snake_case, use underscores to separate multiple words in a variable name\n",
    "(e.g., user_name, total_amount, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "10.Choose appropriate data types: Select meaningful names based on the variable's data type, such as str for strings, num for numbers, arr for arrays,\n",
    "etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.Avoid excessively long names: While descriptive names are essential, avoid creating unnecessarily long variable names, as it can reduce code \n",
    "readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.Use singular form for singular objects: For variables representing singular objects, use the singular form in the name (e.g., car instead of cars).\n",
    "\n",
    "13.Use plural form for collections: For variables representing collections or arrays, use the plural form in the name (e.g., names instead of name).\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "#Q2. What will happen if we declare a restricted keyword as a variable?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "If you declare a restricted keyword as a variable in a programming language, it will typically result in a syntax error or compilation error. \n",
    "Restricted keywords, also known as reserved words, are predefined words in the programming language that have specific meanings and purposes. They \n",
    "are used to define the language's syntax and cannot be used for other purposes like naming variables, functions, or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you try to declare a variable with a restricted keyword, the compiler or interpreter will recognize it as an invalid use of the keyword and raise an error. This error will prevent the program from being executed or compiled successfully.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "#Q3. Can we actually declare a string as a variable name?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "In Python, you cannot directly create a variable with a string as its name using traditional variable assignment. Attempting to do so will raise a syntax error.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "#Q4. Is it possible for us to declare “_” as a variable? If so, then write an example of it.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "es, in many programming languages, it is possible to declare a variable with the name \"_\" (underscore). The underscore is a valid character for variable names in most programming languages and is often used as a variable name when the value is not needed or is intended to be ignored.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "#Q5. Using an example, explain how the variables in python are dynamic in nature.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "In Python, variables are dynamic in nature, which means they can change their data type and value during the program's execution. Unlike some statically-typed languages, where variables are bound to a specific data type and cannot be changed later, Python allows for more flexibility with its dynamic typing.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "#EXAMPLE\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "print(\"x =\", x) \n",
    "x = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "print(\"x =\", x)  \n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
